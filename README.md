# RuSShdown
## A new RSS feed generator for non-coders.

RuSShdown lets you make an RSS feed without touching a single line of code, with posts that support Markdown, like you'd make on cohost!

RuSShdown works in your browser, uses absolutely no cookies, and runs 100% client-side. You can download the source code and pore through it yourself, if you'd like.

Try it out [here.](https://chaiaeran.github.io/RuSShdown/)
